# Identifying the Risks of Loneliness in the Netherlands
## The problem
Loneliness is a persistent, detrimental, and growing health crisis in the Netherlands. Any new insights into the underlying causes, effects, and successful intervention can support the battle.

The project goals are :
- Map datasets that are relevant to the problem
- Formulate a problem that can be solved by AI research
- Analyze and present results in an understandable matter
- Potentially build a dashboard to explore different scenarios, e.g. different interventions or economic scenarios
